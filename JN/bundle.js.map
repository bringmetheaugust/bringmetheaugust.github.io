If a work-in-progress render is discarded before\n// finishing, we create a new work-in-progress by cloning the current queue.\n//\n// Both queues share a persistent, singly-linked list structure. To schedule an\n// update, we append it to the end of both queues. Each queue maintains a\n// pointer to first update in the persistent list that hasn't been processed.\n// The work-in-progress pointer always has a position equal to or greater than\n// the current queue, since we always work on that one. The current queue's\n// pointer is only updated during the commit phase, when we swap in the\n// work-in-progress.\n//\n// For example:\n//\n//   Current pointer:           A - B - C - D - E - F\n//   Work-in-progress pointer:              D - E - F\n//                                          ^\n//                                          The work-in-progress queue has\n//                                          processed more updates than current.\n//\n// The reason we append to both queues is because otherwise we might drop\n// updates without ever processing them. For example, if we only add updates to\n// the work-in-progress queue, some updates could be lost whenever a work-in\n// -progress render restarts by cloning from current. Similarly, if we only add\n// updates to the current queue, the updates will be lost whenever an already\n// in-progress queue commits and swaps with the current queue. However, by\n// adding to both queues, we guarantee that the update will be part of the next\n// work-in-progress. (And because the work-in-progress queue becomes the\n// current queue once it commits, there's no danger of applying the same\n// update twice.)\n//\n// Prioritization\n// --------------\n//\n// Updates are not sorted by priority, but by insertion; new updates are always\n// appended to the end of the list.\n//\n// The priority is still important, though. When processing the update queue\n// during the render phase, only the updates with sufficient priority are\n// included in the result. If we skip an update because it has insufficient\n// priority, it remains in the queue to be processed later, during a lower\n// priority render. Crucially, all updates subsequent to a skipped update also\n// remain in the queue *regardless of their priority*. That means high priority\n// updates are sometimes processed twice, at two separate priorities. We also\n// keep track of a base state, that represents the state before the first\n// update in the queue is applied.\n//\n// For example:\n//\n//   Given a base state of '', and the following queue of updates\n//\n//     A1 - B2 - C1 - D2\n//\n//   where the number indicates the priority, and the update is applied to the\n//   previous state by appending a letter, React will process these updates as\n//   two separate renders, one per distinct priority level:\n//\n//   First render, at priority 1:\n//     Base state: ''\n//     Updates: [A1, C1]\n//     Result state: 'AC'\n//\n//   Second render, at priority 2:\n//     Base state: 'A'            <-  The base state does not include C1,\n//                                    because B2 was skipped.\n//     Updates: [B2, C1, D2]      <-  C1 was rebased on top of B2\n//     Result state: 'ABCD'\n//\n// Because we process updates in insertion order, and rebase high priority\n// updates when preceding updates are skipped, the final result is deterministic\n// regardless of priority. Intermediate state may vary according to system\n// resources, but the final state is always the same.\n\nvar UpdateState = 0;\nvar ReplaceState = 1;\nvar ForceUpdate = 2;\nvar CaptureUpdate = 3;\n\n// Global state that is reset at the beginning of calling `processUpdateQueue`.\n// It should only be read right after calling `processUpdateQueue`, via\n// `checkHasForceUpdateAfterProcessing`.\nvar hasForceUpdate = false;\n\nvar didWarnUpdateInsideUpdate = void 0;\nvar currentlyProcessingQueue = void 0;\nvar resetCurrentlyProcessingQueue = void 0;\n{\n  didWarnUpdateInsideUpdate = false;\n  currentlyProcessingQueue = null;\n  resetCurrentlyProcessingQueue = function () {\n    currentlyProcessingQueue = null;\n  };\n}\n\nfunction createUpdateQueue(baseState) {\n  var queue = {\n    baseState: baseState,\n    firstUpdate: null,\n    lastUpdate: null,\n    firstCapturedUpdate: null,\n    lastCapturedUpdate: null,\n    firstEffect: null,\n    lastEffect: null,\n    firstCapturedEffect: null,\n    lastCapturedEffect: null\n  };\n  return queue;\n}\n\nfunction cloneUpdateQueue(currentQueue) {\n  var queue = {\n    baseState: currentQueue.baseState,\n    firstUpdate: currentQueue.firstUpdate,\n    lastUpdate: currentQueue.lastUpdate,\n\n    // TODO: With resuming, if we bail out and resuse the child tree, we should\n    // keep these effects.\n    firstCapturedUpdate: null,\n    lastCapturedUpdate: null,\n\n    firstEffect: null,\n    lastEffect: null,\n\n    firstCapturedEffect: null,\n    lastCapturedEffect: null\n  };\n  return queue;\n}\n\nfunction createUpdate(expirationTime) {\n  return {\n    expirationTime: expirationTime,\n\n    tag: UpdateState,\n    payload: null,\n    callback: null,\n\n    next: null,\n    nextEffect: null\n  };\n}\n\nfunction appendUpdateToQueue(queue, update) {\n  // Append the update to the end of the list.\n  if (queue.lastUpdate === null) {\n    // Queue is empty\n    queue.firstUpdate = queue.lastUpdate = update;\n  } else {\n    queue.lastUpdate.next = update;\n    queue.lastUpdate = update;\n  }\n}\n\nfunction enqueueUpdate(fiber, update) {\n  // Update queues are created lazily.\n  var alternate = fiber.alternate;\n  var queue1 = void 0;\n  var queue2 = void 0;\n  if (alternate === null) {\n    // There's only one fiber.\n    queue1 = fiber.updateQueue;\n    queue2 = null;\n    if (queue1 === null) {\n      queue1 = fiber.updateQueue = createUpdateQueue(fiber.memoizedState);\n    }\n  } else {\n    // There are two owners.\n    queue1 = fiber.updateQueue;\n    queue2 = alternate.updateQueue;\n    if (queue1 === null) {\n      if (queue2 === null) {\n        // Neither fiber has an update queue.

Most commonly\n * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\n * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\n *\n * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\n * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the components.\n * It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For example we can\n * add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * import Transition from 'react-transition-group/Transition';\n *\n * const duration = 300;\n *\n * const defaultStyle = {\n *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\n *   opacity: 0,\n * }\n *\n * const transitionStyles = {\n *   entering: { opacity: 0 },\n *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\n * };\n *\n * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\n *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\n *     {(state) => (\n *       <div style={{\n *         ...defaultStyle,\n *         ...transitionStyles[state]\n *       }}>\n *         I'm a fade Transition!\n *       </div>\n *     )}\n *   </Transition>\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * As noted the `Transition` component doesn't _do_ anything by itself to its child component.\n * What it does do is track transition states over time so you can update the\n * component (such as by adding styles or classes) when it changes states.\n *\n * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\n *  - `'entering'`\n *  - `'entered'`\n *  - `'exiting'`\n *  - `'exited'`\n *\n * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component begins the\n * \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from its current transition state,\n * to `'entering'` for the duration of the transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once\n * it's complete. Let's take the following example:\n *\n * ```jsx\n * state = { in: false };\n *\n * toggleEnterState = () => {\n *   this.setState({ in: true });\n * }\n *\n * render() {\n *   return (\n *     <div>\n *       <Transition in={this.state.in} timeout={500} />\n *       <button onClick={this.toggleEnterState}>Click to Enter</button>\n *     </div>\n *   );\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state and\n * stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) before it finally switches to `'entered'`.\n *\n * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\n *\n * ## Timing\n *\n * Timing is often the trickiest part of animation, mistakes can result in slight delays\n * that are hard to pin down. A common example is when you want to add an exit transition,\n * you should set the desired final styles when the state is `'exiting'`. That's when the\n * transition to those styles will start and, if you matched the `timeout` prop with the\n * CSS Transition duration, it will end exactly when the state changes to `'exited'`.\n *\n * > **Note**: For simpler transitions the `Transition` component might be enough, but\n * > take into account that it's platform-agnostic, while the `CSSTransition` component\n * > [forces reflows](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/blob/5007303e729a74be66a21c3e2205e4916821524b/src/CSSTransition.js#L208-L215)\n * > in order to make more complex transitions more predictable. For example, even though\n * > classes `example-enter` and `example-enter-active` are applied immediately one after\n * > another, you can still transition from one to the other because of the forced reflow\n * > (read [this issue](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/issues/159#issuecomment-322761171)\n * > for more info). Take this into account when choosing between `Transition` and\n * > `CSSTransition`.\n */\n\nexports.EXITING = EXITING;\n\nvar Transition =\n/*#__PURE__*/\nfunction (_React$Component) {\n  _inheritsLoose(Transition, _React$Component);\n\n  function Transition(props, context) {\n    var _this;\n\n    _this = _React$Component.call(this, props, context) || this;\n    var parentGroup = context.transitionGroup; // In the context of a TransitionGroup all enters are really appears\n\n    var appear = parentGroup && !parentGroup.isMounting ?
